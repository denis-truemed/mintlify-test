Truemed's APIs can be leveraged to enable partner-managed recurring billing (subscriptions) through our `payment_token` product. Partners can offer Truemed as an option for existing subscribers as well as enabling stored-payment-method like functionality for new customers. In either case, partners are notified via the `payment_token_callback` webhook when the `payment_token` can be used to create subsequent `payment_session`s.

For new customers, use `create_payment_session` with `tokenize=True` to provision a `payment_token`. With this approach, the payment processing for the initial order and token provisioning are started with the same call. In addition to the `payment_token_callback` webhook mentioned above, a separate `payment_session_complete` webhook will be sent indicating that the first order indicating that the initial order can be fulfilled.

For existing customers, call `create_payment_token` with information about the items already subscribed to. Partners will be notified via the `payment_token_callback` webhook when the `payment_token` can be used to create subsequent `payment_session`'s.
