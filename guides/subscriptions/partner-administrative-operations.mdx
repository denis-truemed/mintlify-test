These are operations useful to customer support teams, but may not be functionality exposed to end-users as part of a subscription management dashboard.

## View Active Subscriptions

Partners can use this endpoint to reconcile subscription state between their system and Truemed, help support agents review or manage subscription issues, or show active subscriptions in a user’s **“My Subscriptions”** dashboard.

The [`list_payment_token`](/reference/list-payment-tokens) endpoint provides `payment_token`s for all customers associated with the partner’s account.

This endpoints allow tokens to be filtered by

- email
- A range of tokens using created created_at range
- lmn_expiration
- card_expiration

## **Monitor Expiration Dates**

Truemed recommends a recurring background job filter for expirations occurring within the next 30 days and emailing customers to update their payment method or retake the survey.

## **Cancel or Terminate a Subscription**

Using the `delete_payment_token` permanently cancels a `payment_token`. This disables future charges — any attempt to use the token with `create_payment_session` will return a `NotFound` error.

NOTE:

- Deletion is irreversible — tokens cannot be reactivated.
- To support pause/resume flows or grace periods, manage that logic internally and delete the token only when final.
