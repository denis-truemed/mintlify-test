## Welcome to the Truemed API

The Truemed Merchant Integration API enables payment processing and qualification management for HSA/FSA transactions. This API allows merchants to integrate Truemed's payment solutions into their checkout flows.

## Base URLs

The API is available across three environments:

- **Production**: `https://api.truemed.com`
- **Staging**: `https://staging-api.truemed.com`
- **Development**: `https://dev-api.truemed.com`

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using API keys sent in the request header:

```bash
x-truemed-api-key: your_api_key_here
```

There are two types of API keys:

1. **REST API Key** (`truemed-api-key-rest`): Used for server-to-server authentication when calling Truemed endpoints
2. **Webhook API Key** (`truemed-api-key-webhook`): Used by Truemed to authenticate webhook requests to your endpoints

## API Sections

### Payment Sessions
Create and manage payment sessions for one-time payments and authorizations. Includes support for manual capture, void, cancel, and refund operations.

### Payment Tokens
Manage stored payment methods and subscription billing through tokenized payment methods.

### Qualification Sessions
Determine customer eligibility for HSA/FSA spending through qualification sessions and Letter of Medical Necessity (LMN) verification.

### Webhooks
Receive real-time notifications about payment status changes, token updates, and qualification results.
